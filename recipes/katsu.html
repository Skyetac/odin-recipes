        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Katsu curry is super-delicious and is one of Japan’s most popular dishes. Its heart is Indian spices, which were brought through the spice trade to Britain, where we manufactured our first curry powder; then, back again through trade, they went to Japan, along with the French technique of thickening sauces with a roux (fat and flour) – and the katsu curry was born. Katsu was traditionally made with pork, but I have to say, chicken is my favourite</p>
